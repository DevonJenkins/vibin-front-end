              //THEN take that mapped array and split or shift it somehow? 

              //Will I need a handler that takes care of this every time i click?

              //On Click, the process will happen again to bring up a new band.
              
              //to simplify this, a user will have to select a preferred genre. It seems more simple to base it on one genre rather than an array of genres. 

                  //How would we do it with an array?

                //Not yet Accepted
                //Not yet Rejected
                //Matches Genre Preference

              //if not band, then direct to the "start a band" page
